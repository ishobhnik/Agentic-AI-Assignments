        "\n",
        "1. Venture-backed AI startups now hinge on prompt quality, not model ownership.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. It is the cheapest, fastest way to improve an LLM’s performance.\n",
        "\n",

        "### What Prompt Engineering Can Do\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Help structure the output of an LLM**: Guides the model to produce responses in specific formats, like JSON, lists, or step-by-step reasoning.\n",
        "2. **Improve response relevance and accuracy**: Uses techniques like few-shot examples or chain-of-thought to elicit better, more targeted answers without altering the model.\n",
        "3. **Enable task-specific adaptations**: Customizes LLM behavior for tasks like summarization, translation, or code generation through careful phrasing.\n",
        "4. **Reduce hallucinations**: Incorporates instructions to cite sources or verify facts, minimizing incorrect outputs.\n",
        "5. **Enhance creativity and control**: Directs the model to role-play, brainstorm ideas, or follow ethical guidelines in responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What Prompt Engineering Cannot Do\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Change the LLM's internal weights and model parameters**: It doesn't modify the underlying architecture or trained values of the model.\n",
        "2. **Train or fine-tune the model**: Prompting can't update the model's knowledge base or teach it new information permanently.\n",
        "3. **Access or alter training data**: It has no influence on the dataset used to build the LLM.\n",
        "4. **Guarantee perfect outputs**: It can't eliminate all biases, errors, or limitations inherent in the model's pre-training.\n",
        "5. **Replace model architecture changes**: It won't fix fundamental issues like context window limits or computational constraints.\n",

Precision (ratio of true positives to predicted positives) helps understand how many approved loans are actually good.
